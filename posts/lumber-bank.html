      This is going to by my first writeup on malware analysis, something I've marveled at from afar, but never *really* got into before now.
      A little background on me first, but you won't hurt my feelings if you skip it. I'm a high school dropout and self taught programmer, I
      started learning C shortly after discovering Linux, later on learned Golang, and turned that into a career. I have a few stories to tell, and I feel
      like I can be somewhat entertaining in my writing, so here we are. You might be wondering why this is just a plain HTML page with a dark
      background. Part of that is because I have an edgy aesthetic and I'm not sorry about it, and because I miss the time when every page you
      click on didn't have a shitload of javascript and resources to download with ridiculous "functionality" that really just serves to annoy.
      Although I usually distance myself from old-school GNU/FOSS guys (looking at you, rms), I do appreciate plain text and simple layouts they're 
      known for, so that's what I'm doing. Take it or leave it, I'm trying to provide information. That's it. I hope you can take something away from my writing.
      </br></br>
      These initial posts are going to be a bit of a test. I've been programming for about 10 years now (about half of that "professionally")
      so I'd like to jump in this with the skills and knowledge I have on hand, just to see how much I *actually* know. I like to make myself
      laugh, so you'll have to deal with stupid jokes along the way, but I'm hoping I can provide some kind of valuable technical analysis and
      insight at the end.

      Like I said before, this is my first "real" foray into malware analysis. I put the word out to some friends that I wanted to get into it
      and shortly after got a few samples of unknown quality and origins. The first sample, and the sample this innaugural post will be about,
      is what I'm going to call "LumberBank" (I've found no other samples like it elsewhere, so I'm naming it myself). LumberBank is a 
      banking trojan, that was masqurading as a pirated copy of a game that is still in development, called "Lumbermill" (I have no connection to 
      the developer of that game. If you are the dev and you want me to rename the malware to not step on your thing, hit me up).
