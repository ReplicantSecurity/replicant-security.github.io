      This is going to by my first writeup on malware analysis, something I've marveled at from afar, but never *really* got into before now.
      A little background on me first, but you won't hurt my feelings if you skip it. I'm a high school dropout and self taught programmer, I
      started learning C shortly after discovering Linux, and blah blah blah, turned it into a career. I hate computers, so studying computers
      getting fucked up is kind of on-brand for me.
      </br></br>
      These initial posts are going to be a bit of a test. I've been programming for about 10 years now (almost half of that "professionally")
      so I'd like to jump in this with the skills and knowledge I have on hand, just to see how much I *actually* know. I like to make myself
      laugh, so you'll have to deal with stupid jokes along the way, but I'm hoping I can provide some kind of valuable technical analysis and
      insight.
      </br></br>
      Like I said before, this is my first "real" foray into malware analysis. I put the word out to some friends that I wanted to get into it
      and shortly after got a few samples of unknown quality and origins. The first sample, and the sample this innaugural post will be about,
      is what I'm going to call "LumberBank" (I've found no other samples like it elsewhere, so I'm attaching my own name to it).
      </br></br>
      LumberBank is a banking trojan, that was masqurading as a pirated copy of a game that is still in development, called "Lumbermill" (I have
      no connection to the developer of that game. If you are the dev and you want me to rename the malware to not step on your thing, hit me up).
